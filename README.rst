C++ - ASU Math Lab - Project
===========================

Intro:
-------

Math Lab Project is Written in C++ and it’s mainly depends on the “Matrix Class” as it works with matrices only, it also makes the all main operations on them with accurate results as much as you expect in its first phase and another more complex operations will be added in the next coming phases, in the next section we will go closer to which operations it can do efficiently.

Math Lab can do the following operations:

•	Copy.
•	Add Column.
•	Add Row.
•	Addition.
•	Subtraction.
•	Multiplication.
•	Division.
•	Transpose.
•	Determinant.
